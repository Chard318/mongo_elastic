        "About_me": "Hi! I am a Chemical Engineer from IIT Kharagpur, India and joined Shell in 2014 as a graduate engineer in PACO P&T Bangalore.  Currently I am a Modelling & Optimization Engineer in the IG Asset Support Organization providing support to the IG Assets in the east.  I have in the past supported the Controls Improvement Program in Tabangao and have been involved in the Advanced Process Control revamp of the site.   I am also the MDPro Focal point for the east and have provided hands-on training to users and provided configuration support and set up MDPro for assets like QGC, Tabangao, Sabah, Sarawak. MDPro is a real time monitoring and diagonistic tool to evaluate the health of Base Layer, IPF and APC loops in an Asset. For more info, please write to me or holler me at the number mentioned in the GAL. In the past, I have been involved in pre DG3 Base Layer work and do take the liberty as and when possible in widening my horizon by learning about Automation and Instrumentation.  When I am not working, you would most probably find me sketching away. Fine arts feature numero uno on my list of hobbies. I love travelling and like capturing those moments on my camera. While travelling, i do resort to savouring the local flavours and i do make it a point to adding them to my cooking repetoire.",
