        "About_me": "Born in 1981, hold a BS degree in Civil Engineering and MSc in Earthquake Engineering. I started my engineering career as a Seismic & Structural Engineer being involved in the projects of design and strengthening of bridges and buildings against earthquake (2005-2008). Moved to the Netherlands in 2008 and became a researcher at TU Delft. Working on various R&D projects, e.g. strengthening of steel orthotropic decks with epoxy materials, and life-time extension of concrete bridges and tunnels, received a PhD in Structural Engineering.My career in Shell started in early 2014 when I joined P&T, CSO (Civil,Structural & Offshore) discipline in Rijswijk. My role as a civil/structural engineer in Shell, included involvement in projects of site master planning \u2013 Assess Phase, CSO focal Point and coordinator of the civil supports to the existing LNG assets as part of the BRNC projects supported by the IG sector, R&D research on CO2 capturing into construction materials, and update of the Shell Concrete Bridges and Culverts Infobase. In 2015, I moved as a project engineer civil & structural to NAM, to work in the project of assessment and structural upgrading of infrastructures, oil & gas facilities, and buildings, being responsible for managing several simultaneous projects, with vast skills in civil and structural engineering, and coordinating engineering and design. Since March 2018, I am back to P&T in Rijswijk, working in the Asset Support - IG Europe Team, and being responsible for coordination of the CSO BRNC activties, various civil support to IG assets, and R&D.",
