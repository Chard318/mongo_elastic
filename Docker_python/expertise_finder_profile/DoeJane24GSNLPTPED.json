        "About_me": "I joined Shell in 2007 as exploratory researcher having graduated in BSc Biochemical Engineering and MSc in Marine Microbiology, both in Germany. I started off in Biofuels focusing on R&D novel options, managing interface with joint ventures and doing Competitive Technology Intelligence.  I moved to EUHT in 2011 as Water Treatment and Integration Engineer, during which time I worked in various areas including sludge handling and effluent water treatment options for projects as well as supported projects from identify, assess and select phases. A huge focus has been in the Effluent Treatment area with support to Pearl GTL: start-up and commissioning of biotreater and Major Around Technology support.  I have performed scouting studies including Pearl ETP Debottlenecking study and Pernis Scouting study to recommend solutions to enable Pernis meet new legislation BREF requirements for its effluent. In my free time, I like to read and travel \u2013 exploring different cities, cultures and cuisines",
