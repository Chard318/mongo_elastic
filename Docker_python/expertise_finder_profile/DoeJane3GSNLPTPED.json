        "About_me": "As per March 1st (2018), I am working as an Inspection (NDE) Engineer within P&T's Asset Support organization, responsible for our Integrated Gas assets. I spend most of my time working on projects related to improve Shell's performance on Corrosion Under Insulation (CUI). To stress the importance of this topic: as an industry we spend 3-4B$ on CUI maintenance per annum.   I am an Applied Physicist by educational background and joined Shell in August 2015 as Flow Assurance Engineer; my focus then was on multiphase flow using fluid flow simulators such as PIPESIM, OLGA, and USD-Compas?.  During the work week, I regularly go running close to our Amsterdam office.",

In some cases, the speed of the pig is an issue as product flow velocities exceed the optimum pig speed. A relatively new approach to overcome this problem is to use speed control pigs, such that the production deferment is avoided. In this project, we aim for further improving speed control pigs.",
