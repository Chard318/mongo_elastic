        "About_me": "Joined Shell in September 2015 as a Civil & Structural Engineer. I am part of the Civil, Structural and Offshore (CSO) team in Rijswijk, Netherlands and provide technical services to projects and assets within EMEA. I primarily support the Integrated Gas (IG) superbucket, providing Civil input on Regas opportunities. I'm originally from Dorset in the United Kingdom and later moved to London. There I Studied Civil & Environmental Engineering (MEng) at Imperial College and completed a thesis on the statistics of extreme waves in wind-driven seas. During my degree I was successful in an Assessed Internship with Shell, leading to my graduate role. The topic of my internship was LNG Import Terminal Concepts and the decision process for Identify \u2013 Select on these opportunities.",
