        "About_me": "I studied Metallurgical Engineering at Dalhousie University in Halifax. I originally started my career in Aerospace working on the repair and overhaul of military aircraft.  In 2008 I joined Shell's Scotford Upgrader as a Materials and Corrosion Engineer supporting a wide variety of processing units.  Since that time I have also worked in Upstream Americas Unconventionals where I provided Materials and Corrosion, as well as Mechanical Static fitness-for-service support to Foothills sour gas, tight gas (shale oil), and Heavy Oil in-situ assets.  Currently I am working for Projects and Technology Engineering Services out of the Shell Technology Center Calgary.",
