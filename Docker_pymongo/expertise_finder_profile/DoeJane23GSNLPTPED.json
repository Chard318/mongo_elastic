        "About_me": "I joined Shell in 1991, after graduating in Chemical Engineering at Twente University  (NL). Currently I am leading the Utilities and Heat Transfer discipline in the East with a team that that is distributed between Bangalore and Kuala Lumpur, and a skillpool that is present in most assets in Asia Pacific. This skillpool generates value by managing CO2 emissions, efficient energy and water supply, and efficient treatment of water streams, in compliance with existing and emerging regulation. We also provide design and operational support for all utilities systems, desalters, water treatment facilities, furnaces and heat exchangers. I started my career in technical and operational roles in Refining and Process Control and Optimisation. In 2006, I moved to Kuala Lumpur as Process Integrator, where I led the front-end development of the BUGIS/SCOT and HIJAU projects. I also developed a global process integration skillpool and managed the process integration of a global Downstream Programme to improve energy efficiency (CaFEE). From 2011 to 2015 I was the CO2 projects manager in Group CO2, providing functional support to all large projects in the Upstream and Downstream.  In October 2015 I moved to Bangalore with my family. I am married and have two daughters. I enjoy reading a good book, watching a good movie and having a meal in the company of good people.",
