        "About_me": "I joined Shell in 2002 and was coming from the boiler maker Babcock Borsig Power Environment (former Steinmueller) were I worked 10 years as mechanical design engineer for Waste Heat Boilers and Process Gas Cooler.  I started my carrier by Shell as design Engineer for Gasifier and Syngas Effluent Cooler for Coal Gasification projects. Later I was further educated in thermohydraulic design by training on the job. Site experience I got in around one year in China for commissioning of the first coal gasification plants, by trouble shooting and inspections. I also was involved in building up spare part manufacturing workshops close to the operating plants.  Currently I work as Hating and Thermal Equipment Engineer for Syngas Effluent cooler in Oil and Gas Gasification. I am married and have 1 child. My hobbies are my family,  boat trips with my sloep and trips by bicycle.",
