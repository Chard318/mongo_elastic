        "About_me": "Originally a marine engineer I have gained experience in gas turbine maintenance and installation during my preShell employement. As a mature hire I have worked for Shell at different foreign assignments, at Tabangao Refinery and Malaysia LNG. Since 2005 I work from HQ in the RE LNG Group primarily in the operational and maintenance advisory role. I feel best in having a good balance between office and field work.",
