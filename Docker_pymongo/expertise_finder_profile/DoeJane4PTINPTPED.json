        "About_me": "Michael joined Shell in 2002 at the Scotford Chemical Plant as a site Project Engineer.  Since then he spent over 10 years in Downstream Manufacturing Sites (Scotford and Deer Park) in a variety of roles ranging from discipline engineering (Rotating Equipment) to Reliability Engineering to Production and Operations. This has resulted in a passion for Rotating Equipment and Engineering, but also have a broader background in Downstream manufacturing and Operations.   Mike joined P&T in 2012 as the Team Lead for the Rotating Equipment team based in Calgary, Canada and then took on a multi-discipline team lead role in 2016 when the Rotating, Electrical, Materials & Corrosion and Mechanical Static teams in Calgary combined.  Throughout these roles the teams have provided outstanding support to both Assets and Projects in Canada and Regionally/Globally accross Shell's lines of business, from Downstream to Unconventionals, and from Heavy Oil to Integrated Gas.",
