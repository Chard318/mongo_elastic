        "About_me": "Jarno was born in Terborg (Achterhoek), the Netherlands in 1974 and graduated in 1998 in Mechanical Engineering. He joined Shell as a Junior Rotating Equipment Engineer in 2002, upon working a couple of years in the Semiconductor Industry in the Netherlands. Following various positions all in the Rotating Equipment Engineering space in the Pernis refinery, Jarno moved to Shell Global Solutions in 2012, where he joined the Rotating Equipment Downstream Support Team. In this role, he supported as across Shell and Third Party, mainly downstream assets in the EMEA region with focused projects in: Moerdijk Chemical Plant, the Netherlands; Pernis Refinery, the Netherlands; Fredericia Refinery, Denmark; and Sapref Refinery, South Africa and KNPC in Kuwait. He has participated in the first major turnaround from Pearl GTL as Technical Authority in 2015. He was overall responsible for all Rotating Equipment in scope in the Fresh Gas Processing Unit and Liquid Processing Unit.   Jarno is looking forward starting in his new role in the Integrated Gas, Gas to Liquid Asset Support Team to further improve the overall GTL site performance. Jarno lives happily together with Kirsten who works as head of the Hematologic/ Oncology laboratory at the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam. He likes to play squash and he tries to do once a week a Bootcamp session. In case spare time is left, he likes to work on modernization activities in and around his house and he enjoys time with family and friends.  I am looking forward to work with all of you and I am always keen to learn from you!",
